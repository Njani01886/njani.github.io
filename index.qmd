I am Nayan Jani, a dedicated graduate student with a Bachelor's degree in Data Science from the University of Rhode Island. Currently, I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science (DACSS) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a solid foundation in data cleaning and processing, advanced quantitative methods, machine learning, and data visualization, and I am eager to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges.
