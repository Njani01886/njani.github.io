# Summary

üîç What I Bring to the Table:

- Ability to collect and analyze large sets of structured and unstructured data to identify and interpret meaningful trends or patterns.

- A robust understanding of regression assumptions for different statistical methods (enabling me to select the most appropriate analysis procedure based on the data's characteristics).

- Expertise in cleaning and preprocessing data to ensure that it is suitable for analysis (e.g., handling missing values, restructuring data).

- Adept at developing and implementing statistical models and machine learning algorithms to solve complex problems and make predictions.

- Ability to create data visualizations to effectively communicate findings and facilitate data exploration.

- Experience in presenting data-driven insights and recommendations using accessible language tailored to the audience.

- Proficiency in Python (Pandas, Sci-kit learn, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib), R (tidyverse, ggplot2), and Microsoft Office.

- A collaborative and proactive approach to teamwork.

ü§ù Open to Opportunities:
I am actively seeking a Data Analyst or Data Scientist role in healthcare and education where I can contribute my skills and continue my professional development. If your organization is looking for a motivated graduate with who loves challenges and wants to do good with data, I would love to connect and explore potential opportunities.

Let's connect and discuss how my skills align with the needs of your team!

Thank you for considering my profile, and I look forward to connecting with fellow professionals in the field.

# Projects

U.S. Job Satisfaction: Impacts of Technology, Work Environment, and Covid-19                        September-December 2023

- Investigated if the move to more work from home and more use of technology at work post-COVID actually lead to any significant changes in job satisfaction using data from the 2018 and 2022 versions of the General Social Survey.
- Developed two ordered logit GLMs using the MASS package in R: one main effect model and one interaction model
- Calculated predicted probabilities of job satisfaction for all significant variables (p <0.05) using ggpredict() and graphed them with 95% confidence intervals using ggplot().
- Discovered that people who never work from home are significantly less likely to to be very satisfied with their job than people who mainly WFH (p <0.05), with all variables held constant.

Identifying Sources of Poor Nutrition for Americans, Amherst, MA                                           July-August 2023
Project Owner
- Analyzed the impact of food sources on food and nutrient intakes for different ages and income levels using 2017-18 Food and Nutrient Density by Food Source and Demographic Characteristics datasets
- Created multiple charts that visualized the 3 way associations between food source, demographics and food/nutrient density using    
  ggplot2 in R
- Discovered that adults and seniors were consuming more cholesterol at restaurants than at home, low and middle income individuals 
  had lower intakes of protein at home than away from home
- Cleaned and combined datasets using the tidyverse package in R in order to produce visualizations
- Explained methods and results using language that a non-technical audience could understand in a 29 page report
